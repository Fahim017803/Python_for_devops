# 🚀 DAY-10 DEVOPS CAPSTONE
# ===============================

capstone:
  # ---- Proof that this project solves a real DevOps problem ----
  proof_statement: >
    Used Python to solve a real DevOps-style operational problem
    through automation and system-level thinking.

  # ---- What this capstone includes (scope) ----
  includes:
    - Log analysis using Python
    - Non-interactive, automation-ready script
    - Clear exit codes (machine-readable outcome)
    - Designed for CI/CD pipelines and cron-based workflows
    - One clean, working flow (not overengineered)

  # ---- Interview explanation using STAR method ----
  star_explanation:
    situation:
      - Logs were growing daily
      - Manual checking was time-consuming and unreliable
      - No quick signal to understand system health

    task:
      - Automate log analysis using Python
      - Make the solution reusable and automation-friendly

    action:
      - Parsed logs to identify error patterns
      - Structured logic with clear functions and comments
      - Designed the script to run non-interactively
      - Used exit codes for automation pass/fail decisions

    result:
      - Manual log inspection eliminated
      - Errors became visible immediately
      - Script usable in cron jobs and CI/CD pipelines
      - Demonstrated automation, reliability, and ownership

  # ---- DevOps mindset learned from this project ----
  devops_mindset:
    realisation:
      - Python was not a random language choice
      - Python is a DevOps enabler, not just a scripting language

  # ---- What this capstone demonstrates ----
  demonstrates:
    - End-to-end thinking
    - Small tools solving real problems
    - Reliability over complexity
    - Clear communication using the STAR method

  # ---- Final takeaway ----
  one_line_reflection: >
    DevOps is not about tools —
    it is about solving problems reliably
    under real-world constraints.
