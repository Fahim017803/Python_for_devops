🚀 Capstone – Python for DevOps

Codeforces → DevOps | Problem-Solving to Production Thinking

🔹 What I Built

Python-based DevOps utility

Automated log analysis

Simple HTTP health check API

Lightweight, service-oriented design

🔹 Why This Was Needed

Logs grow every day

Manual checking is slow

No quick way to verify system health

Not scalable in real systems

🔹 How I Thought About the Problem

(Codeforces-style approach applied to DevOps)

Identified the core problem first

Broke the system into small, deterministic steps

Focused on correctness and edge cases

Avoided unnecessary complexity

🔹 S.T.A.R Explanation
Situation

Logs increasing daily

Manual inspection inefficient

Task

Automate log analysis

Provide a reliable health check

Action

Parsed logs using Python

Structured logic with clear functions

Wrapped automation with FastAPI

Exposed /health endpoint

Ran service using Uvicorn

Result

Manual effort reduced

Faster error visibility

System health observable via HTTP

🔹 DevOps Thinking Demonstrated

Python → automation enabler

API → service contract

Logs → operational signals

Small tools → reliable systems

🔹 One-Line Summary

Turned manual operational work into an automated, observable DevOps service using Python.
