  proof_statement: >
    Used Python to solve a real DevOps-style operational problem
    through automation and system-level thinking.

  includes:
    - Log analysis using Python
    - Non-interactive, automation-ready script
    - Clear exit codes (machine-readable outcome)
    - Designed for CI/CD pipelines and cron-based workflows
    - One clean, working flow (not overengineered)

  star_explanation:
    situation:
      - Logs were growing daily
      - Manual checking was time-consuming and unreliable
      - No quick signal to understand system health

    task:
      - Automate log analysis using Python
      - Make the solution reusable and automation-friendly

    action:
      - Parsed logs to identify error patterns
      - Structured logic with clear functions and comments
      - Designed script for non-interactive execution
      - Used exit codes to control automation pass/fail

    result:
      - Manual log inspection eliminated
      - Errors became visible immediately
      - Script usable in cron jobs and CI/CD pipelines
      - Demonstrated automation, reliability, and ownership

  devops_mindset:
    realisation:
      - Python was not a random language choice
      - Python is a DevOps enabler, not just a scripting language

    devops_is_about:
      - Automation
      - Reliability
      - Problem-solving
      - Ownership

    takeaway: >
      No longer learning syntax —
      learning how production systems are handled.

  demonstrates:
    - End-to-end thinking
    - Small tools solving real problems
    - Reliability over complexity
    - Clear communication using the STAR method

  one_line_reflection: >
    DevOps is not about tools —
    it is about solving problems reliably
    under real-world constraints.
