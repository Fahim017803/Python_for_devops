## 🔹 Goals of This Repository
- Learn Python from a DevOps perspective  
- Write clean, simple, reusable scripts  
- Build CLI-based tools instead of menu-driven apps

## 🔹 Where These Scripts Can Be Used
Designed to integrate easily with real systems:
- Shell scripts  
- Cron jobs  
- CI/CD pipelines  

---

## 🔹 Core Principles
- Automation over manual work  
- Simplicity over complexity  
- Reusability over one-off scripts  
- System thinking over syntax
