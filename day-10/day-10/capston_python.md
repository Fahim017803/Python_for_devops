🔹 Capstone Proof Statement

I used Python to solve a real DevOps-style operational problem using automation and system thinking.

🔹 What This Capstone Includes

Log analysis using Python

Non-interactive, automation-ready script

Clear exit codes (machine-readable outcome)

Designed to fit into CI/CD or cron-based workflows

One clean, working flow — not overengineered.

🔹 S.T.A.R Explanation (Interview-Ready)
Situation

Logs were growing daily

Manual checking was time-consuming and unreliable

No quick signal to understand system health

Task

Automate log analysis using Python

Make the solution reusable and automation-friendly

Action

Wrote a Python script to parse logs and identify error patterns

Structured the logic clearly with functions and comments

Designed the script to run non-interactively

Used exit codes so automation systems can decide pass/fail

Result

Manual log inspection was eliminated

Errors became visible immediately

The script can be plugged into cron jobs or CI/CD pipelines

Demonstrated automation, reliability, and ownership

🔹 DevOps Engineer Mindset (Key Realisation)

Python was not a random language choice

Python is a DevOps enabler, not just a scripting language

DevOps is about:

Automation

Reliability

Problem-solving

Ownership

I am no longer learning syntax —
I am learning how production systems are handled.

🔹 What This Capstone Demonstrates

End-to-end thinking

Small tools solving real problems

Focus on reliability over complexity

Clear communication using the STAR method

🔹 One-Line Reflection

DevOps is not about tools — it’s about solving problems reliably under real-world constraints.
