# Python for DevOps 🐍⚙️

This repository contains my **Python learning and practice work focused on DevOps use cases**.  
The goal is to use Python as a **tool for automation, scripting, and system-level tasks**, not just general programming.

I am learning Python step by step with a DevOps mindset:  
**write scripts → convert them into CLI tools → make them automation-ready**.

- Learn **Python from a DevOps perspective**
- Practice writing **clean, simple, and reusable scripts**
- Build **CLI-based tools** instead of interactive programs
