# Python for DevOps – Automation & Scripting

This repository contains my **Python learning and practice work focused on DevOps use cases**.  
The goal is to use Python as a **tool for automation, scripting, and system-level tasks**, not just general programming.

I am learning Python step by step with a DevOps mindset:  
**write scripts → convert them into CLI tools → make them automation-ready**.
